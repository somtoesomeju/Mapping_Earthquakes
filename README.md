# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Purpose
In this project, I am creating an interactive website that gives users information about earthquakes in a given area. The map allows them to get information like where the quakes occured and the intensity of the earthquakes.

# Resources
- Software: Visual Studio Code
- Languages: Javascript (JS6), GeoJSON, HTML, CSS

# Results
after modifying my JS and CSS files, I was able to create an interactive website. As mentioned above, this website allows users to get earthquake information when they select a certain point in the map. An example is seen [here].
